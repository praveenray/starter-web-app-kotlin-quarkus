### To start development:

1. install node and npm on your machine and make sure these are in your PATH
1. node --version should respond
1. npm --version should respond
1. cd to this folder in a terminal (or powershell window on Windows)
1. run `npm install`
1. run `npm run tsc -- -watch`
1. leave this window open. The Typescript compiler is running in watch mode

Now you can update your _.ts_ files anywhere in `static` folder and it'll be automatically compiled to _js_
